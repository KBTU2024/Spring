<h1>The Help</h1>
<h2>chapter 1</h2>
<h2>August 1962</h2>

<p>MAE MOBLEY was born on a early Sunday morning in August, 1960. A
    church baby we like to call it. Taking care a white babies, that’s what I do, along
    with all the cooking and the cleaning. I done raised seventeen kids in my
    lifetime. I know how to get them babies to sleep, stop crying, and go in the toilet
    bowl before they mamas even get out a bed in the morning.</p>

<p>I LOST MY OWN BOY, Treelore, right before I started waiting on Miss
    Leefolt. He was twenty-four years old. The best part of a person’s life. It just
    wasn’t enough time living in this world.</p>
